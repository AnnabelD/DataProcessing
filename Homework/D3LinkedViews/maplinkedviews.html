		<h2>Populations sizes of countries, their well-being and their ecological footprints</h2>

		<p> All the data of these visualizations come from the Happy Life index (http://www.happyplanetindex.org/)</p>
		<h5>The Ecological Footprint</h5>
		<p>The ecological footprint is a measure for how much land is needed to sustain one's population.
		Thus if a country has an ecological footprint of 2, to sustain it's own population it would need a land area of twice its own size.</p>
		<h5> Well-being</h5>
		<p>The well-being of a population is based on the Gallup World Poll, which is a questionnaire that questioned 1000 individuals over 15 in each country.</p>
		<h5> The Story</h5>
		<p>These data show that there is some sort of correlation (not causation) between well-being and ecological footprint. The data could be used to support a 
		story about the influence of experienced well-being on the ecological footprint, although it would have to be supported by some evidence that there is also causation.</p>
		<h5>Design</h5>
		<p>The colour schemes of these visualizations are basically the same. All data is expressed in a shade of blue ("no data" is grey) and if a datapoint
		is selected it becomes green to attract the attention. The Scatterplot shows the overall trend of the data and allows to look for outliers. 
		The barchart allows the user to compare a country with the world average, and the map visualization enables the user to make a link to population size.
		Although that link would be easier to explore in another scatter plot. For example population size plotted against well-being or footprint, perhaps with
		buttons, so that the user can decide for him/herself which trend should be made visible. 
		It would have been best to include units in the labels of the plots, unfortunately, neither ecological footprint nor well-being have very understandable 
		units.</p>
